These files helped me to develop my dissertation project. I used them to manipulate data from the VINTERGATAN simulation in order to identify stellar streams and shells around the Milky Way and predict the discovery of any more. In total, 9 streams, 26 shells and 3 merger events were identified using simulation data spanning 13 billion years.
